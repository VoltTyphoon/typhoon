# Volt Typhoon

## Background and Overview

Volt Typhoon is a state-sponsored hacking group based in China, active since at least mid-2021 [oai_citation:0‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Volt%20Typhoon%20has%20been%20active,our%20visibility%20into%20these%20threats). It typically focuses on cyber espionage and information gathering against U.S. critical infrastructure [oai_citation:1‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20uncovered%20stealthy%20and,Asia%20region%20during%20future%20crises). U.S. government agencies assess that Volt Typhoon has **pre-positioned access** in the networks of multiple organizations – especially in the Communications, Energy, Transportation, and Water sectors – to potentially disrupt or destroy critical services during a future crisis or conflict [oai_citation:2‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=The%20U,S). This means Volt Typhoon could attempt to sabotage communications and other infrastructure in the event of heightened geopolitical tensions [oai_citation:3‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20uncovered%20stealthy%20and,Asia%20region%20during%20future%20crises) [oai_citation:4‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=Bureau%20of%20Investigation%20,105). Such capabilities represent a serious national security risk, as an attack could impact not only the United States but also allied countries due to the interconnected nature of critical systems [oai_citation:5‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=Bureau%20of%20Investigation%20,105).

Volt Typhoon’s choice of targets and tactics goes beyond traditional espionage. The group has infiltrated organizations in Guam and across the U.S., spanning sectors like communications, manufacturing, utilities, transportation, maritime, government, information technology, and education [oai_citation:6‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Volt%20Typhoon%20has%20been%20active,our%20visibility%20into%20these%20threats). Once inside a network, the threat actor’s **priority is stealth** – maintaining long-term access without detection [oai_citation:7‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Volt%20Typhoon%20has%20been%20active,our%20visibility%20into%20these%20threats). In fact, some Volt Typhoon intrusions persisted undetected for **several years** in victim networks [oai_citation:8‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=cyber%20activity%20when%20targeting%20critical,and%20understanding%20the%20target%20environment), demonstrating the group’s patience and operational security. Security researchers have also identified Volt Typhoon by other aliases (e.g. *Vanguard Panda*, *BRONZE SILHOUETTE*, *Dev-0391*, *UNC3236*, *Voltzite*, *Insidious Taurus*), as various cybersecurity organizations track this same threat actor [oai_citation:9‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=observations%20from%20the%20U,UNC3236%2C%20Voltzite%2C%20and%20Insidious%20Taurus).

## Tactics and Techniques

Volt Typhoon is known for using “**living off the land**” (LotL) techniques [oai_citation:10‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=To%20achieve%20their%20objective%2C%20the,C2%29%20channel). Rather than deploying custom malware, the hackers leverage the victim’s own operating system tools and legitimate network software to carry out their objectives [oai_citation:11‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=,described%20in%20these%20joint%20products). They operate hands-on-keyboard through command-line interfaces, issuing commands to gather local and network information, dump credentials, and compress files for exfiltration [oai_citation:12‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=To%20achieve%20their%20objective%2C%20the,C2%29%20channel). Notably, Volt Typhoon avoids obvious malware or implants – it relies on built-in administration utilities (also called **LOLBins**, for “living-off-the-land binaries”) and stolen valid credentials to blend in with normal activity [oai_citation:13‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=To%20achieve%20their%20objective%2C%20the,C2%29%20channel) [oai_citation:14‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=,described%20in%20these%20joint%20products). By using valid accounts and default system tools, the group can **easily evade many security detections** that look for malware signatures [oai_citation:15‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=PRC%20State,described%20in%20these%20joint%20products). This tradecraft has allowed Volt Typhoon to maintain persistence on some networks for extended periods.

One hallmark of Volt Typhoon’s campaign is how it **masks its traffic and avoids raising alarms**. The group routes its communications through compromised small office/home office (SOHO) networking devices – such as home routers, firewalls, and VPN hardware – owned by unwitting third parties [oai_citation:16‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=,C2%29%20channel). By tunneling their commands and data through these intermediate devices, Volt Typhoon’s actions appear to originate from typical residential or business internet addresses, helping them **blend into normal network traffic** [oai_citation:17‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=,C2%29%20channel). Microsoft has confirmed that many such SOHO routers (from manufacturers like ASUS, Cisco, D-Link, NETGEAR, Zyxel, etc.) were used as proxies by Volt Typhoon [oai_citation:18‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Typhoon%20tries%20to%20blend%20into,C2%29%20channel) [oai_citation:19‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Volt%20Typhoon%20proxies%20all%20its,overhead%20costs%20for%20acquiring%20infrastructure). The actors also modified and used legitimate open-source tools to establish encrypted command-and-control (C2) channels over these proxies [oai_citation:20‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Typhoon%20tries%20to%20blend%20into,further%20stay%20under%20the%20radar). All of these methods reduce the attackers’ need to purchase or expose their own infrastructure and make attribution and detection more difficult.

For initial compromise, Volt Typhoon often exploits internet-facing devices and applications. In one observed campaign, they leveraged vulnerabilities in **Fortinet FortiGuard** network appliances to gain access to victim networks [oai_citation:21‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Initial%20access). They then used the privileges from those devices (e.g. an Active Directory service account) to move laterally through the IT environment [oai_citation:22‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Typhoon%E2%80%99s%20methods%20for%20gaining%20access,to%20these%20devices). The group also monitors public vulnerability disclosures and rapidly targets unpatched systems (for example, known CVEs in server management or networking equipment) to penetrate organizations before fixes are applied [oai_citation:23‡socradar.io](https://socradar.io/apt-profile-volt-typhoon/#:~:text=Exploiting%20Known%20Vulnerabilities%3A%20The%20group,gaining%20unauthorized%20access%20to%20systems). Once inside, Volt Typhoon conducts extensive reconnaissance specific to the victim’s environment – mapping network topology, identifying key systems and personnel, and adapting their techniques accordingly [oai_citation:24‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=cyber%20activity%20when%20targeting%20critical,and%20understanding%20the%20target%20environment). This careful, tailored approach indicates a high level of planning and skill, consistent with an advanced persistent threat.

## Detection and Mitigation

Detecting Volt Typhoon’s activity is **challenging**, because the group’s techniques generate little that appears obviously malicious to standard security tools [oai_citation:25‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=PRC%20State,described%20in%20these%20joint%20products). There are typically no distinct malware files or easily flagged anomalies – the attackers use valid credentials and common administration commands, “living off the land” to hide in plain sight [oai_citation:26‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=,described%20in%20these%20joint%20products). As the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) notes, Volt Typhoon’s use of built-in system functions means organizations need a **comprehensive, multi-faceted** defense strategy [oai_citation:27‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=malware%20to%20maintain%20access%20to,described%20in%20these%20joint%20products). In practice, this includes robust monitoring of system and network behavior to catch subtle signs of intrusion.

**Strong logging and monitoring are critical.** Security teams should ensure that detailed logs (authentication logs, command history, PowerShell logs, etc.) are enabled and centrally collected for analysis [oai_citation:28‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=,need%20to%20effectively%20detect%20compromise). Careful log review can reveal anomalous usage of legitimate tools – for instance, command-line sequences or account activities at odd hours that align with Volt Typhoon tactics [oai_citation:29‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=,need%20to%20effectively%20detect%20compromise). CISA emphasizes that **robust logging is necessary to detect and mitigate LotL techniques** [oai_citation:30‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=,need%20to%20effectively%20detect%20compromise). Organizations may need to improve their logging configurations and retention, and provide security staff with tools to analyze those logs for patterns associated with this threat.

In addition to logging, defenders should implement strict **access controls and network segmentation**. Using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access and administrative accounts can help prevent Volt Typhoon from reusing stolen passwords. Network segmentation – especially between IT and operational technology (OT) networks – can limit an attacker’s ability to pivot to sensitive systems (Volt Typhoon is assessed to prepare for disrupting OT processes like electric grids or pipelines) [oai_citation:31‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=The%20U,S). Regularly review accounts and disable or reset credentials that are no longer needed, to shrink the pool of valid logins an attacker could abuse.

Organizations are also urged to **apply patches promptly** to all internet-facing devices and critical systems. Volt Typhoon has been observed exploiting known vulnerabilities to gain entry [oai_citation:32‡socradar.io](https://socradar.io/apt-profile-volt-typhoon/#:~:text=Exploiting%20Known%20Vulnerabilities%3A%20The%20group,gaining%20unauthorized%20access%20to%20systems). Keeping software up-to-date and eliminating exposure of management interfaces (like router admin consoles) to the internet can thwart many of their initial access attempts [oai_citation:33‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Volt%20Typhoon%20proxies%20all%20its,overhead%20costs%20for%20acquiring%20infrastructure). Similarly, replacing or updating SOHO routers with the latest firmware and using strong, unique passwords can prevent those devices from being hijacked as proxy nodes.

Cybersecurity authorities recommend that critical infrastructure owners treat threats like Volt Typhoon as a top-level business risk [oai_citation:34‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=Bureau%20of%20Investigation%20,105). This includes conducting regular security awareness training (so staff can recognize social engineering or phishing attempts) and practicing incident response plans (e.g. drills to respond to a suspected intruder using live-off-the-land tactics) [oai_citation:35‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=,Ensuring%20comprehensive%20and). Close collaboration with government agencies and sharing information about any detected Volt Typhoon activity is also encouraged, to enable a coordinated defense. By combining technical measures (logging, network defenses) with organizational preparedness and user education, defenders can better counter this sophisticated adversary.

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

Given Volt Typhoon’s stealthy methods, **indicators of compromise** can be subtle. However, cybersecurity analysts and government agencies have compiled some concrete IoCs associated with Volt Typhoon operations [oai_citation:36‡socradar.io](https://socradar.io/apt-profile-volt-typhoon/#:~:text=IoCs%20Related%20to%20Volt%20Typhoon). These include specific IP addresses, malware file hashes, and other artifacts observed in known intrusions. Security teams can use these indicators to hunt for Volt Typhoon activity in their own networks. (Note: IP addresses and simple hashes alone are not definitive proof of compromise, but they can provide leads for further investigation.)
