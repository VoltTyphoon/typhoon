# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: What is Volt Typhoon?**  
A: Volt Typhoon is the code name for a **Chinese state-sponsored hacking group** identified in 2023 as targeting U.S. critical infrastructure. According to Microsoft Threat Intelligence, Volt Typhoon is based in China and focuses on espionage and information gathering [oai_citation:56‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20uncovered%20stealthy%20and,Asia%20region%20during%20future%20crises). The group is classified as an advanced persistent threat (APT) that has infiltrated organizations in sectors like communications, energy, transportation, and more, likely to prepare for potential disruptive cyberattacks during a future crisis [oai_citation:57‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=The%20U,S).

**Q: Who is behind Volt Typhoon?**  
A: Volt Typhoon is attributed to the government of the **People’s Republic of China (PRC)**. In other words, it’s a state-sponsored cyber actor linked to Chinese intelligence or military operations [oai_citation:58‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Microsoft%20has%20uncovered%20stealthy%20and,Asia%20region%20during%20future%20crises). Multiple cybersecurity agencies (NSA, CISA, FBI, and partners) have confirmed the group’s Chinese origin and warn that its activities align with PRC strategic interests [oai_citation:59‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=The%20U,S). Other cybersecurity companies tracking this group have given it different nicknames, but they all point to a coordinated hacking team working on behalf of China’s state cyber program.

**Q: Does Volt Typhoon go by any other names?**  
A: Yes. Various security vendors and agencies have identified Volt Typhoon under different **aliases**. For example, it has been referred to as **“Vanguard Panda,” “BRONZE SILHOUETTE,”** and **“DEV-0391,”** among others [oai_citation:60‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=observations%20from%20the%20U,UNC3236%2C%20Voltzite%2C%20and%20Insidious%20Taurus). Mandiant (Google) tracks it as **UNC3236**, and another nickname seen in reports is **“Insidious Taurus.”** These all refer to the same threat group. Microsoft adopted “Volt Typhoon” as part of its new naming convention for threat actors.

**Q: Why is it called “Volt Typhoon”?**  
A: The name comes from Microsoft’s threat actor taxonomy introduced in 2023. In this scheme, **“Typhoon” indicates a Chinese state-sponsored group** (each nation-state got a weather-themed family name) [oai_citation:61‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/18/microsoft-shifts-to-a-new-threat-actor-naming-taxonomy/#:~:text=In%20our%20new%20taxonomy%2C%20threat,in%20the%20new%20naming%20convention). The “Volt” part is a unique adjective assigned to this specific group to distinguish it from other Chinese actors [oai_citation:62‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/18/microsoft-shifts-to-a-new-threat-actor-naming-taxonomy/#:~:text=In%20our%20new%20taxonomy%2C%20threat,in%20the%20new%20naming%20convention) [oai_citation:63‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/04/18/microsoft-shifts-to-a-new-threat-actor-naming-taxonomy/#:~:text=Threat%20actors%20within%20the%20same,works%20for%20Russia%20and%20Iran). The name doesn’t describe the group’s behavior literally; it’s an internal codename. So “Volt Typhoon” essentially means “the Chinese threat actor codenamed Volt.”

**Q: How long has Volt Typhoon been active?**  
A: Investigators believe Volt Typhoon has been active **since mid-2021** [oai_citation:64‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Volt%20Typhoon%20has%20been%20active,our%20visibility%20into%20these%20threats). However, it remained undiscovered for some time. The campaign was first publicly revealed in May 2023, when Microsoft and U.S. agencies published alerts about ongoing Volt Typhoon intrusions [oai_citation:65‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=In%20May%202023%2C%20the%20authoring,and%20its%20territories%2C%20including%20Guam). Even after those disclosures, follow-up reports in 2024 showed the group was still active and had broadened its reach. In some cases, Volt Typhoon maintained undetected access in networks for months to years before the 2023 discovery [oai_citation:66‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=cyber%20activity%20when%20targeting%20critical,and%20understanding%20the%20target%20environment).

**Q: What targets does Volt Typhoon go after?**  
A: Volt Typhoon specifically targets **critical infrastructure** organizations, primarily in the United States (including territories like Guam). Confirmed targets span the Communications sector (e.g. telecom networks), Energy sector (power utilities), Transportation systems, and Water and wastewater systems [oai_citation:67‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=The%20U,S). The group appears interested in companies and utilities whose disruption could have a large impact. There are also indications of it targeting other sectors (government, defense, maritime, education) to gather intelligence [oai_citation:68‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=Volt%20Typhoon%20has%20been%20active,our%20visibility%20into%20these%20threats). While the U.S. has been the focus, allied nations’ infrastructure could be at risk by extension [oai_citation:69‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=States%20and%20its%20territories%2C%20including,sponsored%20actors%20is).

**Q: What techniques does Volt Typhoon use?**  
A: Volt Typhoon is known for stealthy, hands-on tactics, especially **“living off the land”**. This means they largely avoid deploying malware and instead use legitimate system tools and administrator commands on the victim network [oai_citation:70‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=To%20achieve%20their%20objective%2C%20the,C2%29%20channel). For example, they use tools like PowerShell, Windows Command Shell, and WMI to enumerate systems and harvest data, rather than custom malware. They also exploit valid user credentials (obtained by cracking password hashes or keylogging) to move laterally and persist [oai_citation:71‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=To%20achieve%20their%20objective%2C%20the,C2%29%20channel). Another technique is routing their traffic through compromised home/office routers to mask their origin [oai_citation:72‡microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/05/24/volt-typhoon-targets-us-critical-infrastructure-with-living-off-the-land-techniques/#:~:text=,C2%29%20channel). Volt Typhoon operators are very interactive (manual keyboard operations) and adapt their methods in real-time to avoid detection.

**Q: What are signs that an organization has been compromised by Volt Typhoon?**  
A: Because Volt Typhoon uses standard tools, the signs can be subtle. **Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)** tied to Volt Typhoon include unusual patterns in command-line usage and unexpected network connections. For instance, an IoC might be known malicious IP addresses communicating with internal systems (e.g. an IP range associated with prior Volt Typhoon C2 servers) [oai_citation:73‡socradar.io](https://socradar.io/apt-profile-volt-typhoon/#:~:text=IoCs%20Related%20to%20Volt%20Typhoon). Other IoCs are the presence of certain file hashes corresponding to tools the group deploys, or evidence of compromised router firmware. In practice, defenders should look for abnormal administrator activity: command executions at odd hours, archival of sensitive data in strange locations, and remote access traffic that doesn’t match normal user behavior. A list of example IoCs is provided in our report’s IoC section.

**Q: How can we defend against Volt Typhoon?**  
A: Defending against Volt Typhoon requires **strong fundamentals** in cybersecurity. First, enable comprehensive logging and actively monitor those logs for anomalies (Volt Typhoon’s actions can often be spotted by careful analysis of command histories and login records) [oai_citation:74‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=,need%20to%20effectively%20detect%20compromise). Use multi-factor authentication and strict privileged account management so that stolen credentials alone aren’t enough for the attackers to freely move around. Ensure all internet-facing devices (VPN gateways, firewalls, IoT devices, etc.) are up-to-date on patches – Volt Typhoon frequently exploits unpatched vulnerabilities to get in [oai_citation:75‡socradar.io](https://socradar.io/apt-profile-volt-typhoon/#:~:text=Exploiting%20Known%20Vulnerabilities%3A%20The%20group,gaining%20unauthorized%20access%20to%20systems). Network segmentation is important too: isolate critical systems and OT networks from the general IT network, which can limit the blast radius if an IT account is compromised [oai_citation:76‡cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a#:~:text=The%20U,S). Finally, user education and incident response readiness are key. Train administrators to recognize signs of living-off-the-land attacks, and have an incident response plan that accounts for an attacker who might already have domain admin credentials. By combining preventive measures (patching, MFA, principle of least privilege) with detective measures (thorough monitoring, threat hunting for known IoCs), organizations can significantly reduce the risk from Volt Typhoon [oai_citation:77‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=,need%20to%20effectively%20detect%20compromise) [oai_citation:78‡cyber.gov.au](https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/prc-state-sponsored-cyber-activity_actions-for-critical-infrastructure-leaders#:~:text=,Ensuring%20comprehensive%20and).
